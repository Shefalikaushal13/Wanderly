Wanderly
My first full-stack web development project, Wanderly. This project, built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Gemini AI API and other Google APIs, offers:

📍Personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences, such as budget, interests, trip duration etc.
📍Hotel Recommendations for each place based on the user’s budget.
📍Google Maps integration: by clicking on the hotel and places to visit card, users may access contact details, more photographs, directions to the location, and links to pertinent websites.
📍Saved trips: When logged in, users can see the trips they created using Wanderly.
📍Realistic pictures of the corresponding places.

Due to paid features, it has become unavailable after a while.

I put everything I had into this project, and I'm really happy with how it turned out🫶.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Do get in touch with me if you encounter any bugs or problems.
